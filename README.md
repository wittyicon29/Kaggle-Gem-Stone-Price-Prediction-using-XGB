# Kaggle-Gem-Stone-Price-Prediction-using-XGB

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science competitions, and one of the challenges that has been posted on the platform is predicting the price of gemstones. The dataset contains information about various features of gemstones, such as carat weight, cut quality, color, and clarity, along with the corresponding price.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a machine learning algorithm that is often used for regression and classification problems. It is an ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to produce a final output. XGBoost is known for its speed, scalability, and high accuracy, and it has won several data science competitions on Kaggle.

Gemstone price prediction using XGBoost, the first step is to load and preprocess the dataset. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical values. Once the data is preprocessed, it can be split into training and testing sets.

Next, XGBoost is applied to the training data to create a predictive model. The hyperparameters of the algorithm are tuned to optimize the performance of the model. This involves selecting the best values for parameters such as learning rate, maximum depth, and number of estimators.

After the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on the test data. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.
